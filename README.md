## About
This is a kubernetes device plugin that can discover and expose GPUs for passthrough on a kubernetes node. This device plugin will enable to launch GPU attached [Kata](https://katacontainers.io/) VM based containers in your kubernetes cluster. Its specifically developed to serve Kata workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.


## Features
- Discovers Nvidia GPUs which are bound to VFIO-PCI driver and exposes them as devices available to be attached to VM in pass through mode.
- Performs basic health check on the GPU on a kubernetes node.

## Prerequisites
- Need to have Nvidia GPU configured for GPU passthrough. Quickstart section provides details about this
- Kubernetes version >= v1.11
- Kata release >= v3.23.0

## Quick Start

Before starting the device plug, the GPUs on a kubernetes node need to configured to be in GPU pass through mode.

### Preparing a GPU to be used in pass through mode
GPU needs to be loaded with VFIO-PCI driver to be used in pass through mode

##### 1. Enable IOMMU and blacklist nouveau driver on KVM Host

  Append "**intel_iommu=on modprobe.blacklist=nouveau**" to "**GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX**" 
```shell
$ vi /etc/default/grub
# line 6: add (if AMD CPU, add [amd_iommu=on])
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=centos/root rd.lvm.lv=centos/swap rhgb quiet intel_iommu=on modprobe.blacklist=nouveau"
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
```
###### Legacy Mode (BIOS)
```shell 
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
reboot
```
###### UEFI Mode
```shell 
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg
reboot
```

After rebooting, verify IOMMU is enabled using following command
```shell
dmesg | grep -E "DMAR|IOMMU"
```
Verify that nouveau is disabled
```shell
dmesg | grep -i nouveau
```

##### 2. Enable vfio-pci kernel module

**Determine vendor-ID and device-ID of the GPU using following command**

```shell
lspci -nn | grep -i nvidia
```
In the example below the vendor-ID is 10de and device-ID is 1b38
```shell
$ lspci -nn | grep -i nvidia
04:00.0 3D controller [0302]: NVIDIA Corporation GP102GL [Tesla P40] [10de:1b38] (rev a1)
```

**Update VFIO config**
```shell
echo "options vfio-pci ids=vendor-ID:device-ID" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```
Considering vendor-ID is 10de and device-ID is 1b38 command will be as follows
```shell
echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1b38" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```
**Update config to load VFIO-PCI module after reboot**
```shell
echo 'vfio-pci' > /etc/modules-load.d/vfio-pci.conf
reboot
```

**Verify VFIO-PCI driver is loaded for the GPU**
```shell
lspci -nnk -d 10de:
```
Output below shows that "Kernel driver in use" is "vfio-pci"
```shell
$ lspci -nnk -d 10de:
04:00.0 3D controller [0302]: NVIDIA Corporation GP102GL [Tesla P40] [10de:1b38] (rev a1)
        Subsystem: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:11d9]
        Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
        Kernel modules: nouveau
```

## Docs
### Deployment
The daemon set creation yaml can be used to deploy the device plugin. 
```
kubectl apply -f nvidia-sandbox-device-plugin.yaml
```

Example YAMLs for creating VMs with GPU/vGPU are in the `examples` folder

### Build

Change to proper DOCKER_REPO and DOCKER_TAG env before building images
e.g.
```shell
export DOCKER_REPO="quay.io/nvidia/nvidia-sandbox-device-plugin"
export DOCKER_TAG=devel
```

Build executable binary using make
```shell
make
```
Build docker image
```shell
make build-image DOCKER_REPO=<docker-repo-url> DOCKER_TAG=<image-tag>
```
Push docker image to a docker repo
```shell
make push-image DOCKER_REPO=<docker-repo-url> DOCKER_TAG=<image-tag>
```
### To Do
- Improve the healthcheck mechanism for GPUs with VFIO-PCI drivers
- Support GetPreferredAllocation API of DevicePluginServer. It returns a preferred set of devices to allocate from a list of available ones. The resulting preferred allocation is not guaranteed to be the allocation ultimately performed by the devicemanager. It is only designed to help the devicemanager make a more informed allocation decision when possible. It has not been implemented in sandbox-device-plugin.
